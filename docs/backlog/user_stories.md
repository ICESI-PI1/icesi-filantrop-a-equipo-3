## **Prioritization**

Now we're going to prioritize the user stories according to the relevance of the functionality and the resources needed on it.

In this case, we will choose to prioritize tasks based on the skills of the work team. Therefore, we have determined a score from $1$ to $5$, where $1$ would be the task with fewer assigned resources and workers, and $5$ would be the task with more assigned resources and workers.

- **User Story 10:** We consider it requires a level $5$ prioritization.

- **User Story 4:** We consider it requires a level $5$ prioritization.

- **User Story 6:** We consider it requires a level $5$ prioritization.

- **User Story 14:** We consider it requires a level $4$ prioritization.

- **User Story 9:** We consider it requires a level $4$ prioritization.

- **User Story 8:** We consider it requires a level $4$ prioritization.
