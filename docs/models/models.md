# **MODELS**
In our project we have two models: data model and class diagram.

## **Data Model**
  The data model presents all the entities that are involved in the system, including the relationships they have between them in order to meet the needs and functionalities. Likewise, it seeks to comply with quality attributes such as scalability and maintainability.
  
  - **Logical Model**:
    The logical model is the next

## **Class Diagram**
  The class diagram represents all the classes, entities and objects that are necessary in the system to be able to meet all the requirements and user stories. At the same time, the relationships between each class and the necessary methods are presented. The class diagram is the next:

## **Sequence Diagrams**
  Sequence diagrams represent the flow of the application for each user story, that is, to meet the requirement to which it refers. These diagrams are available in the artifacts folder within models, in Visual Paradigm format.
